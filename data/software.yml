    description: >
      This R package offers a natural feeling, domain-specific language to build and estimate structural equation models in R.
      It uses variance-based PLS estimation to model both composite and common-factor constructs.
      It offers High-level functions to quickly specify interactions and complicated structural models.
      And it offers high performance, multi-core bootstrapping.

    description: >
      This upcoming R package will allow users to generate predictions from PLS models created using SEMinR.
      It will also produce predictive validation scores of constructs, which are of greatest interest to researchers.
