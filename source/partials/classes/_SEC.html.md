This class transforms students understanding of what information security is and their ability to develop secure software. We start from the basics of information theory to cryptographic principles, secure software development, and security policies. Students will learn to develop elements such as single sign-on to enhance authentication, digital signatures and tokens to create secure ecosystems, messaging, configuring content-delivery networks, and more.
