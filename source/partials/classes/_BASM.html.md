This class develops skills to infer knowledge from business data. We will learn how to verify our intuition and theories with simulation, visualization, and statistics.
This class favors computational approaches to boost statistical techniques when data is complex or unusual. We handle both small and large volumes of data, and student teams will analyze real data from partner companies.
